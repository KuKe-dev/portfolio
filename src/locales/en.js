I developed the project solo, using React for the frontend and Java/Spring Boot (to learn backend with a robust language) along with MySQL (due to my personal preference for relational databases). Although the project didn’t solve a critical technical problem, its value lies in the enhanced user experience, allowing users to mark and explore their trips geographically. It was a practical exercise to master frontend-backend integration as well as handling spatial data.",
